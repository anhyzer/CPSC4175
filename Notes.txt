The data point cardio indicates a cardiovascular disease.

There is data that will be missing, we will need to work around that.
Each data group may have a different set of provided data types.

The data we have is the data we have. We need to split the data into training and testing.
We will not be given more data. Sponsor suggests random tree, or similarly advanced algorithms.

Dr Zhou adds that there is not a specific algorithm that we are required to use.
It is up to how we want to get this done.
Also he was supposed to provide the data type's definitions but he accidentally set them as the wrong link.

Specific Requirements: We eventually need to be able to present what ML algorithm and model we used and the prediciton accuracy in a spreadsheet.
No required accuracy, just try our best. (I pointed out that 4K data sets aren't really a whole lot for ML purposes.
