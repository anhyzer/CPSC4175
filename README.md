# CPSC4175
This is a collection of Machine Learning (ML) models used to predict the chance of diabetes in patients.
## Description
We were tasked to create four ML models to take data from a database to predict whether a patient had diabetes. While we had intended to create a program to take user inputs and make predictions based on that, we ultimately decided to focus solely on the performance of the models. The four models in this Git are XGBoost (created by Ryan Zimmermann), AdaBoost (created by Crow Bisson), Random Forest (created by Nam Luu), and LightGBM (created by Elliott Freels). 
## Getting Started
The ML models are to be run in Python Notebooks. Models were programmed in Jupyter Notebooks, but can be run using Google Colab.
## Help
Each section of code in the notebooks should be run in order from top to bottom.
